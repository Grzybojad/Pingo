# Pingo

Pingo is a puzzle game in which your goal is to paint the whole level in as little steps as possible.
Try to earn all 3 stars in 60 hand crafted levels!

All this gorgeous art was done by Jumbocube.

[RobDevs made a level editor](https://github.com/robDevs/pingo-edit) for this game, it was a massive help during development. I'll
try adding custom level support to Pingo, so that you can play around with it yourself.
